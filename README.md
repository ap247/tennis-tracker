## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd tennis-tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash

   ```

3. **Set up Firebase**
   - Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Enable Firestore Database
   - Copy your Firebase config from Project Settings
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Firebase Security Rules

Add these rules to your Firestore database:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /matches/{document} {
      allow read, write: if true; // Update with authentication rules as needed
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

1. **Log a Match**: Fill out the match form with opponent, score, and other details
2. **View History**: Browse all past matches with search and filter options
3. **Check Stats**: View performance statistics and trends
4. **Offline Support**: The app works offline and syncs when connection is restored
